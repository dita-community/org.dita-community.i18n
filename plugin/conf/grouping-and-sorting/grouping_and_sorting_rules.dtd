    This DTD defines documents that configure back-of-the-book
    index generation for different national languages.

    For a given national language index you need the following information:

    - The collation sequence for the characters in the language
    - The headings for the index sections (e.g., "A", "B", "C" in
      English)
    - The mapping of characters in the language to specific headings.
      For example, several different characters might all sort
      under "C" in a particular language.
    - For each sort grouping, the sort order within that grouping.

    - Add ignore_english to sort_method content model.

    2011-11-21 Antenna House, Inc. Toshihiko Makita
    - Change index_config content model to allow multiple language-code to 
      hold dialects.
      The parent language code must be written as the *FIRST* national_language
      element contents.
